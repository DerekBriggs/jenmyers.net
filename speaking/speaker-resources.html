<p>Speaking at conferences, user groups, classes and other assorted events where a tech-minded audience assembles is fun and useful for your career. But sometimes it's hard to figure out what you have to say and how to say it. Recently, I gave a brief talk about getting started as a speaker and why specifically you might want to do it in the first place - here are my notes and links from that talk.</p>

<h4>Speaking Opportunities</h4>

<p><strong>Job interviews.</strong> Obvious, maybe, but during each interview you are essentially giving a presentation expressing a topical point - namely, how great you are. But you're also expressing <em>who</em> you are, which is something you should also do in every presentation, no matter what the topic. Also, some jobs will ask you to create a presentation, as you would for a user group, as part of your interview process. Being capable and prepared to do that sort of thing is an asset when you're just starting your career.</p>

<p><strong>Information sharing within companies.</strong> Sometimes it's hard to keep up with everything your colleagues are doing if you're not working directly with them every day, or if they're active in open-source projects and communities outside of work. And vice versa when it comes to sharing your own newly-gained knowledge. Presenting  within your company about the technical topics you're discovering and mastering not only builds a stronger company culture but provides you with regular opportunities hone your skills speaking to a group of people.</p>

<p><strong>User groups and conferences.</strong> These are probably the opportunities you're thinking of when you think about starting to speak, and that's great. They're good times. These are also usually the easiest opportunities to find and the hardest to feel prepared to do. But it's worth it to be able to continue your learning, create new connections with others in the community and build your reputation.</p>

<h4>The How-To Basics</h4>

<p><strong>Find an opportunity.</strong> Finding the first two opportunities above are fairly straightforward. To find user group speaking opportunities, search for ones in your local area on <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup</a> or reach out via Twitter network. For conferences, <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">Lanyrd</a> has pretty exhaustive lists of both events and call for proposals.</p>

<p><strong>Pick a topic.</strong> Some people will advocate you should pick a topic on which you're an expert. I recommend picking a topic you want to learn about. The process of creating the talk will force you to stretch outside of your comfort zone, organize your thoughts, and come to a new conclusion about something. Also, look for inspiration not just in what you know, but what you've done. Even if you're a beginner. Maybe you have unique experience in another career you can apply to this new one. Maybe you have different life experience that would create an engaging story in a technical context Whatever it is, just be honest about your self, your abilities and your story.</p>

<p><strong>Build the talk.</strong> Create an outline and fill in the details. Make a slide deck if you want, especially for code examples, but don't use too much text or rely too much on a static asset. Focus on the conversation you want to have with the audience, and practice delivering it in a friendly, conversational tone. Ask friends and colleagues for review and feedback.</p>

<h4>Philosophy to Remember</h4>

<p><strong>You do not have to be an expert to speak.</strong> Don't wait until you think you're an expert in something before you step up to speak - you have ideas to share that only you can, so let your individual perspective give your technical talk a personal angle that no one else can replicate. I promise you, most people will care more about you being your authentic self than they will about any one thing you know or don't know.</p>

<p><strong>Approach speaking as an opportunity to learn/have conversations.</strong> Speaking is how I learn about new things and meet new people to learn new things from. I almost always include plenty of time for questions in my talk, because I don't want to lecture one-way, I want to start a conversation. Be open to input. After you're done speaking, chat with audience members, send emails and follow-up on Twitter to keep the conversation going.</p>

<p><strong>Not every conference or audience is for your talk - and that's okay.</strong> You may get negative feedback about your talk. That doesn't mean you or your talk is wrong. It could just mean you weren't at the conference best suited for your talk, or you didn't reach the right audience for your talk. It happens. Take it in stride, address whatever constructive criticism you can, dismiss the rest and look for the next opportunity.</p>
